    <h3><strong> <span>Task 17:</span> Seeing the World:</strong>
    Think of at least five places in the world you’d like to visit.
        <ul>
            <li>Store the locations in a array. Make sure the array is not in alphabetical order.</li>
            <li>Print your array in its original order.</li>
            <li>Print your array in alphabetical order without modifying the actual list.</li>
            <li>Show that your array is still in its original order by printing it.</li>
            <li>Print your array in reverse alphabetical order without changing the order of the original list.</li>
            <li>Show that your array is still in its original order by printing it again.</li>
            <li>Reverse the order of your list. Print the array to show that its order has changed.</li>
            <li>Reverse the order of your list again. Print the list to show it’s back to its original order.</li>
            <li>Sort your array so it’s stored in alphabetical order. Print the array to show that its order has been changed.</li>
            <li>Sort to change your array so it’s stored in reverse alphabetical order. Print the list to show that its order has changed.</li>
