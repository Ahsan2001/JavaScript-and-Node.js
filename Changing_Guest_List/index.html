    <h3><strong> <span>Task 14:</span> Changing Guest List:</strong> 
    You just heard that one of your guests can’t make the dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations. You’ll
    have to think of someone else to invite.

    <ul>
        <li>Start with your program from Exercise 14. Add a print statement at the end of your program stating the name of the
            guest who can’t make it.</li>
        <li>Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it with the name of the new person you are inviting.</li>
        <li> Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still in your list.</li>
    </ul>
