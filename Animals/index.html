    <h3><strong> <span>Task 34:</span> Animals:</strong>
    Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list,
    and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal. • Modify your program to print a statement about each
    animal, such as A dog would make a great pet. • Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in
    common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!
