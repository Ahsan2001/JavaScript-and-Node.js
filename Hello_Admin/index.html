    <h3><strong> <span>Task 29:</span> Hello Admin:</strong>
Make a array of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a
greeting to each user after they log in to a website. Loop through the array, and print a greeting to each user:
    <ul>
        <li>If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?</li>
        <li>Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Eric, thank you for logging in again.</li>
    </ul>
    </h3>
