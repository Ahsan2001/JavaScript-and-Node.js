    <h3><strong> <span>Task 31:</span> Checking Usernames:</strong>
Do the following to create a program that simulates how websites ensure that everyone has a unique username.
    <ul>
        <li>Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.</li>
        <li>Make another list of five usernames called new_users. Make sure one or two of the new usernames are also in the
        current_users list.</li>
        <li>Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already been used. If it has, print a message that the
        person will need to enter a new username. If a username has not been used, print a message saying that the username is
        available.</li>
        <li>Make sure your comparison is case insensitive. If 'John' has been used, 'JOHN' should not be accepted.</li>
    </ul>
